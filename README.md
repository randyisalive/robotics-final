## Installation

Step-by-step installation instructions.

### Install Python 3.10.xx

1. Download Python: Go to the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system (For this project, make sure you download version 3.10.xx).

2. Run the Installer: After downloading, run the Python installer executable you just downloaded. Make sure to check the option to "Add Python x.x to PATH" during the installation. This allows you to use Python from the command line easily.

3. Verify Installation (Optional): Open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and type python --version or python3 --version (depending on your installation). This command will display the installed Python version, indicating a successful installation.

4. Python Environment Variables (Windows Only): On Windows, Python might not be automatically added to the system's environment variables. To check this, search for "Environment Variables" in your system's settings, and under the "System variables" section, look for the "Path" variable. If Python is not added, click "Edit" and add the Python installation path (e.g., C:\PythonXX\).

5. IDE or Text Editor (Optional): You can use any text editor for writing Python code, but using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed for Python can make your coding experience better. Popular choices include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and IDLE (which comes bundled with Python).
